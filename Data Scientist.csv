5.0",Data Scientist,Bengaluru,"Hospitals generate some of the world's richest and most sensitive data. This is often unstructured, siloed and fragmented. Our engineering mission is to give our users transparent, comprehensive access to medical services and their own medical data by integrating directly with hospitals and diagnostics labs and building responsive, intuitive user interfaces.
A sick user’s journey reveals a lot of pain points in current healthcare.

User goes to a hospital, stands in a queue (possibly fills a pre-declaration form for covid), pays at the counter, waits for their turn at the doctor, gets a consultation, and finally leaves.
Wait - I missed the first step - User avoids going to a doctor. I bet you’re guilty of this. The journey above may seem simple enough, but when you’re sick, each step feels like a task.
At Even, we believe that with the right combination of tech and motivation, we can solve everything. After removing payment from user journeys, we now want to solve for visit experiences, focus on teleconsultations, enable users to get home tests - all the while making things faster and secure - because you shouldn’t have to be patient when you’re sick (no pun intended).
